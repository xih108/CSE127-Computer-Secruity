Description of timehack functionality:
For each byte of our guessed password, we run each possible chacracter for 150 times.
Then find the median of the time it takes for the function check_pass for each guess and 
we select the maximum one and make it to be our final guess for that byte. 
As it would take longer for the function check_pass for a correct guess since it needs to check one more byte.
Repeat doing this until we find the correct password.
